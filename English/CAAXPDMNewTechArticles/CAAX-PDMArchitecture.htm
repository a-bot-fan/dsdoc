<h4>1. Client Side Applications</h4>
<p>Any application provides the user interface for X-PDM integration.These 
applications are interacting with user and triggers different X-PDM related 
opeartions.</p>
<h4>2. X-PDM</h4>
<p>X-PDM is a local repository,which serves as a database to X-Apps . X-PDM 
stores the data or files created in this application.</p>
<h4>3. <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE Platform</h4>
<p><span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE platform is a V6 database server. </p>
<h4>4. <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE Platform Event Bus</h4>
<p>The implementation of the Event Bus is based on two gateway to which the event is sent by APIs.
</p>
<p> <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE platform Event Bus is implemented of two Gateways which communicate to each other on http protocol.
 <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE platform  publishes APIs (Command, C++, ws) enabling send Event to
<span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE Gateway. 
 XPG Event  Web Services published by the XPDM Gateway enables My-XPDM to send Event towards 
<span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE Gateway</p>
<h4>5. Bus Adapter</h4>
<p>Bus Adapter provides links between the PDM servers and the Gateway. They 
retrieve events from their local controllers and fetch and process the 
associated data accordingly to the events types and documentation. The 
processing step is the one that will make (if necessary) changes to the PDMs 
objects. The Adapters are also responsible for sending new events to their 
controller. </p>
<p>We are having two adapters:<br />
1) <strong>V6 Adapters</strong> which provides the links between 
V6 database server i.e. <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE platform and <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE Gateway.<br />
2) <strong>XPDM Bus Adapter</strong> which provides the links between X-PDM and 
X-PDM gateway.Customer have to create their own bus adapter in their application.</p>
<p>For details about Bus Adapter refer to
<a href="#References">
Bus Adapter[1]</a>.</p>
<h4>6. Gateway</h4>
<p>Gateway are the dispatchers of events. They receive events via http and 
dispatch them to their local Adapters(Bus Adapter) or remote controller for 
processing. They also take care of event state, persistency. We are 
having two gateways <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE Gateway and X-PDM Gateway.</p>
<p>Here,we are integrating X-PDM with <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE by using event web services. 
This integration allows us to send the data (which is created in any 
application) from X-PDM to <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE platform and also receive the data sent by 
<span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE platform to X-PDM. This scenarios are named as Import(send) and Export(Receive) 
respectively.</p>
<p>For details of gateway refer to
<a href="#References">
Gateway[2]</a>.</p>

<h2> <a name="export"></a>Export Scenario</h2>
<p><a href="#Fig1">Fig.1</a> explains different steps involved in export scenario i.e. Receiving the data 
from <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE platform to X-PDM.</p>
<table>

</tr>
</table>
<ol>
<li> Any V6 command,batch, API or ws invokes the export command <strong><em>
&quot;Send to X-PDM&quot;</em></strong>.</li>
<li> This 
invocation will <strong><em>send an event</em></strong> to<strong> 3D</strong>EXPERIENCE Gateway through http protocol.</li>
<li> When<strong> 3D</strong>EXPERIENCE gateway receives the event it communicates with  <strong>XPGClientService.</strong></li>
<li> <strong>XPGClientService</strong> delegates the processing of this event to  <strong>XPGClientBatch.</strong></li>
<li>  <strong>XPGClientBatch</strong> then exports the data in XPDMXML and is 
uploaded to File Server.This file transfer is of asynchronus mode.</li>
<li> After the local processing of event,<span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE gateway sends this event data to XPDM Gateway 
for remote processing.This event is transfered in sychronous mode.<br /> 
6.1. 
When X-PDM gateway receives the event,it download the data 
attached with event from File server.</li>
<li> X-PDM adapter polls the X-PDM gateway to retrieve the event and the 
associates data.</li>
<li> X-PDM adapter process the event. Refer to <a href="#References">Bus Adapter[3]</a> for detaills 
of how events are processed.</li>
<li> X-PDM adapter send the feedback of this processing to X-PDM gateway.</li>
<li> X-PDM gateway transfers this processing feedback to <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE gateway.</li>
<li> When <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE gateway receives the feedback from X-PDM gateway it will purge this 
event.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Any application having the addins of X-PDM will invoke to <strong>&quot;Send to 
<span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE platform&quot;</strong>.This command will transfer the control to X-PDM adapter.</li>
<li>
X-PDM adapter <strong>sends the 
event</strong> to XPDM gateway.Metadata or bulkdata which is attached with this event 
will be copied to gateways shadow directory.</li>
<li>
XPDM gateway uploads data attached to event in File server in asynchronous file transfer mode.</li>
<li>
After completion of local processing
XPDM gateway sends the event to <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE gateway for remote processing. This transfer is synchronous 
transfer.</li>
<li><span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE gateway will communicates with <strong>XPGClientService</strong> which delegates 
<strong>Import</strong> processing to <strong>XPGClientBatch</strong>.</li>
<li>
This event will be processed at V6 adapters.<br /> 

6.1. <strong>XPGClientBatch </strong>downloads event data in local shadow directory from File 
server.</li>
<li>
V6 adapters sends processing feedback to <span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE gateway.</li>
<li>
<span class="uicontrol">3D</span>EXPERIENCE gateway transfers the processing feedback to X-PDM gateway.</li>
<li>
X-PDM adapter can retrieve the processing feedback from X-PDM gateway and notify 
the user about it.</li>
